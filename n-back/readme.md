# N-Back Tutorial

This tutorial covers creating an n-back task using timeline variables and dynamic parameters. The techniques covered here are probably useful in circumstances where you want to generate a sequence of trials that have some dependencies (like the current trial must sometimes be the same as the trial two items ago) and don't want to manually code a fixed sequence of items.
